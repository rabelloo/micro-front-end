# Micro Front End

Example Micro Front End shell for any renderer (React, Custom Elements, etc.) with zero requirements and a simple interface (a DOM node export).

## Inspect

Run `npm run esm`, a server will be opened in your browser.

Find in `public` the generated code, or inspect the sources in the browser.

It is pretty much how you could write vanilla ECMAScript Modules if you didn't want any niceties like `TypeScript` or `Prettier` and so on.

## Development

Run `npm run start`, `parcel` will start a server and open the browser, as it builds and watches your changes.

## Build

Run `npm run build`, find in `dist` the minified build generated by `parcel`.
