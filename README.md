## Inspect

Run `npm run esm`, a server will be opened in your browser.

Find in `public` the generated code, or inspect the sources in the browser.

It is pretty much how you could write vanilla ECMAScript Modules if you didn't want any niceties like `TypeScript` or `Prettier` and so on.

## Development

Run `npm run start`, `parcel` will start a server and open the browser, as it builds and watches your changes.

## Build

Run `npm run build`, find in `dist` the minified build generated by `parcel`.

## Principles

The interface is simple, every module exports a constant `root` that holds a DOM node.

```ts
interface Module {
  root: Element;
}
```

That DOM node is fully managed by the module and the shell does not tamper with it, except for setting the `id` and the `class` in this example shell (but it could also not touch it period).

Each module is then dynamically imported, in the browser that requires a fully qualified path (either relative or absolute).

```ts
const { root } = await import('https://path.to/module');
```

How the shell is aware of the modules it should load can vary, in the example shell it's hard-coded, but it could also be an HTTP call or user input or anything else.
